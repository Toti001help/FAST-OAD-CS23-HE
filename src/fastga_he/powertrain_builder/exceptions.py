class FASTGAHESingleSSPCAtEndOfLine(FastError):
    """
    Class for managing errors that result from connecting a dc line to an SSPC but only a single
    one. Because of the way equations were coded, if one end of a harness is connected to an
    SSPC, the other shall be as well to allow for a possible opening of the 2 SSPCs.

class FASTGAHEIncoherentVoltage(FastError):
    """
    Class for managing errors that result from connecting two component that sets the voltage of
    their subgraph and set them with a different voltage. This will not cause an error at
    OpenMDAO level, but from experience, it will not converge, so we will make it fail as soon as
    possible.

    """
    Class for managing errors that result from trying to pair with a component that does not exist.
