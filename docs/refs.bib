abstract = {With the increase of power level and integration in electric vehicle controllers, the heat flux of the key silicon-based IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) device has reached its physical limit. At present, third-generation semiconductor devices including SiC MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) are gradually replacing the dominant IGBT module. The hybrid IGBT module consists of both and can improve the performance and reduce the cost of controllers. Limits due to the installation space, location, and other conditions in the car make it difficult to meet the requirements of controllers with an air-cooled heatsink due to their large size and limited heat dissipation capacity. A smaller and more powerful water-cooled heatsink case is required to ensure the heat dissipation of the IGBT in the controller. Based on previous experience in finite element numerical simulation, hydrodynamics calculation, and heat transfer calculation, ANSYS Workbench finite element software was used to analyze the thermal resistance of each structure inside the module and the heatsink structure. The fluid characteristics and heat transfer performance of three different flow channel structures were analyzed, and the design of the cooling flow fin was improved to provide a reference for the heat dissipation of the hybrid IGBT module.},

  abstract = {Accurate modeling of the nonlinear relationship between the open circuit voltage (OCV) and the state of charge (SOC) is required for adaptive SOC estimation during the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery operation. Online SOC estimation should meet several constraints, such as the computational cost, the number of parameters, as well as the accuracy of the model. In this paper, these challenges are considered by proposing an improved simplified and accurate OCV model of a nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) Li-ion battery, based on an empirical analytical characterization approach. In fact, composed of double exponential and simple quadratic functions containing only five parameters, the proposed model accurately follows the experimental curve with a minor fitting error of 1 mV. The model is also valid at a wide temperature range and takes into account the voltage hysteresis of the OCV. Using this model in SOC estimation by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) contributes to minimizing the execution time and to reducing the SOC estimation error to only 3% compared to other existing models where the estimation error is about 5%. Experiments are also performed to prove that the proposed OCV model incorporated in the EKF estimator exhibits good reliability and precision under various loading profiles and temperatures.},

This objective is particularly important for small companies that produce many different batteries in small lots. To develop the product design support system, a preliminary study was necessary. A 3D model was analyzed to simulate real thermal behavior, reproducing a real electric load using a standard ECE-15 cycle. Experimental tests have been conducted on the vehicle and battery to validate the model. An analytical thermal model was developed to evaluate the heat generated by electrochemical reactions inside a Li-ion cell. The outcome of this analytical model was used as the boundary condition in the CFD simulation of the battery model to evaluate the cooling behavior. The rules and results deduced from these studies have allowed the implementation of an easy-to-use knowledge-based configuration tool that supports the designer in the definition of the layout of the battery pack to save time and evaluate costs. As a test case, the battery for an urban freight vehicle was designed using the proposed approach. The achieved results show good performance and robustness of the simplified approach in terms of temperature distribution evaluation and design process efficiency.}

  abstract = {The entropy-variation of a battery is responsible for heat generation or consumption during operation and its prior measurement is mandatory for developing a thermal model. It is generally done through the potentiometric method which is considered as a reference. However, it requires several days or weeks to get a look-up table with a 5 or 10% SoC (State of Charge) resolution. In this study, a calorimetric method based on the inversion of a thermal model is proposed for the fast estimation of a nearly continuous curve of entropy-variation. This is achieved by separating the heats produced while charging and discharging the battery. The entropy-variation is then deduced from the extracted entropic heat. The proposed method is validated by comparing the results obtained with several current rates to measurements made with the potentiometric method.}

  abstract = {Battery thermal management (BTM) is essential to ensure the safety of the battery pack of electric vehicles. For a variety of BTM technologies, the battery’s internal resistance always plays a critical role in the heat generation rate of the battery. Many factors (temperature, SOC and discharge rate) impact on the internal resistance, however, scant research has explored the effect of battery discharge rate on the internal resistance. This study aims to establish a multi-factor dynamic internal resistance model (MF-DIRM) with error compensation strategy to accurately estimate the internal resistance. In the present study, the internal resistance is estimated using the MF-DIRM which fuses three parameters (the temperature, SOC and discharge rate) and the procedures are two-fold: firstly, the coefficients of the binary fourth-order polynomial about the internal resistance with temperature and SOC are obtained, and then the MF-DIRM is built through the cubic spline interpolation algorithm to interpolate these coefficients at different discharge rates. Rather than measure the internal resistance, this model can estimate the internal resistance, and the estimated error does not exceed 10mΩ. Secondly, to further improve the estimation accuracy of MF-DIRM, the error function of the internal resistance is constructed as a binary cubic spline with the temperature and SOC, thereby constructing a model with error compensation strategy. The MF-DIRM combined with error compensation strategy can better estimate resistance under various conditions and the maximum value of estimation error is less than 2.5 mΩ.}

  abstract = {Battery thermal management (BTM) is indispensable to the battery pack of electric vehicles (EVs) for safety. Among different types of BTM technologies, liquid cooling shows its superiority with high heat transfer coefficient and low power consumption. However, the previous works paid little attention to the compactness and weight ratio of liquid-cooled BTM system, which is vital to the specific energy of battery pack. In this study, a compact and lightweight liquid-cooled BTM system is presented to control the maximum temperature (Tmax) and the temperature difference (ΔT) of lithium-ion power battery pack. In this liquid-cooled solution, one thermal conductive structure (TCS) with three curved contact surfaces is developed to cool cylindrical battery. The influences of mass flow rate (mf), inner diameter (d), contact surface height (h) and contact surface angle (α) of the TCS are investigated through numerical study. It is found that for the 5C discharge rate process of battery, Tmax can be maintained within 313 K when mf is larger than 1 × 10−4 kg/s. A weight sensitive factor is defined to evaluate the influences of d, h and α on ΔT and the weight of TCS. It is found that d is the most important parameter that influences the weight. h is the secondary parameter, and α is the parameter with the minimal impact on the weight. Then the values of d, h, and α are designed to reduce the weight of TCS while maintaining its cooling performance. The designed TCS can control Tmax under 313 K with ΔT as 4.137 K. Compared to the original TCS, ΔP, ΔT and the weight are respectively reduced by 80%, 14% and 46% for the designed TCS. Furthermore, the performance of liquid-cooled system with parallel TCSs is discussed. The flow distribution among parallel TCSs is improved through designing the positions of the inlet and the outlet, which enables that Tmax and ΔT of battery pack is similar to the ones of a single battery. The present study facilitates the guideline for compact and lightweight design of liquid-cooled battery thermal management system.}

Nevertheless, the realization of hybrid-electric aircraft demands rigorous environmental impact analysis, given the substantial investments, time, and research required for technology development. This study offers a comprehensive life cycle inventory spanning the years 2030, 2040, and 2050 for both conventional and hybrid-electric aircraft configurations. Our inventory datasets are meticulously constructed through a systematic approach, ensuring data harmonization by drawing upon scientific literature, industry expertise, and primary data sources. This extensive dataset encompasses all pertinent systems necessary to model the environmental footprint of flights covering distances ranging from 200 to 600 nautical miles, utilizing a 50-passenger aircraft with the ATR42 as a reference model. Additionally, we furnish supplemental data for end-of-life considerations and uncertainty analysis. The systems under examination include the airframe, powertrain, power electronics and drives, batteries, fuel cells, hydrogen onboard storage, airport infrastructure, and battery charging stations. Notably, the carbon footprint of conventional aircraft aligns with data from the ecoinvent v3.8 database; however, our provided datasets are more than tenfold more detailed and incorporate a forward-looking perspective. These meticulously curated life cycle inventories can be amalgamated to simulate the potential environmental ramifications of conventional aircraft powered by kerosene or alternative aviation fuels, hybrid-electric aircraft utilizing battery technology, and hybrid-electric aircraft employing hydrogen as a fuel in conjunction with batteries. In this context, our findings play a pivotal role in nurturing the development of technology roadmaps that prioritize environmental sustainability within the realm of regional aviation.}

  abstract = {On-board and off-board performance and cost of cryo-compressed hydrogen storage are assessed and compared to the targets for automotive applications. The on-board performance of the system and high-volume manufacturing cost were determined for liquid hydrogen refueling with a single-flow nozzle and a pump that delivers liquid H2 to the insulated cryogenic tank capable of being pressurized to 272atm. The off-board performance and cost of delivering liquid hydrogen were determined for two scenarios in which hydrogen is produced by central steam methane reforming (SMR) or by central electrolysis. The main conclusions are that the cryo-compressed storage system has the potential of meeting the ultimate target for system gravimetric capacity, mid-term target for system volumetric capacity, and the target for hydrogen loss during dormancy under certain conditions of minimum daily driving. However, the high-volume manufacturing cost and the fuel cost for the SMR hydrogen production scenario are, respectively, 2–4 and 1.6–2.4 times the current targets, and the well-to-tank efficiency is well short of the 60% target specified for off-board regenerable materials.}

The study spans three time horizons (short term, medium term, long term) and employs a validated workflow to estimate costs for various solutions, including conventional, hybrid-electric, and hydrogen-based architectures. A specialized cost model is introduced to assess the electric components of the powertrain, emphasizing maintenance expenses and energy costs. Despite the environmental promise of hybrid and electric solutions, the results reveal significantly higher direct operating costs (up to 69.8%) compared to conventional options. The study highlights the importance of targeted policies to incentivize sustainable alternatives, suggesting potential solutions such as discouraging kerosene-based aircraft and promoting sustainable aviation fuel. These insights provide valuable guidance for industry stakeholders navigating the path toward a more sustainable and economically viable aviation future.}

abstract = {Hydrogen, seen as a promising secondary renewable energy carrier, can becompressed or liquefied as well as chemically bound to enable a more economic storage and transportation. All conditioned hydrogen options obtain specific advantages and disadvantages. Thus, this paper assess the energy efficiency and the cost of a green hydrogen supply from well to tank exemplified for fuel cell heavy-duty vehicles in Germany related to the years 2030 and 2050. Therefore, compressed gaseous hydrogen, liquid hydrogen, liquid organic hydrogen carriers, methanol and ammonia are considered and different hydrogen production regions in North and Central Germany, as well as an import from Tunisia and Argentina (Patagonia) are assumed. The assessment shows that a hydrogen supply chain in its state of aggregation as finally demanded is the lowest cost option leading to 700 bar compressed gaseous hydrogen filling costs of 5 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 and 4 €2020/kgH2 in 2050 and liquid hydrogen filling costs around 7 €2020/kgH2 in 2030 and 6 €2020/kgH2 in 2050.}
