Powertrain builder
==================

FAST-OAD-CS23-HE allows to configure powertrain architectures of hybrid-electric aircraft via a powertrain builder
module. This module can be integrated to the analysis by defining the ``power_train_configuration_file path`` option to
`power_train_sizing` or `performances` model if registered with the corresponding `id` in
`configuration file <https://fast-oad.readthedocs.io/en/stable/documentation/usage.html#problem-definition>`_.

.. code:: yaml

  power_train_sizing:
    id: fastga_he.power_train.sizing
    power_train_file_path: ./<powertrain_config>.yml
  performances:
    id: fastga_he.performances.mission_vector
    â‹®
    power_train_file_path: ./<powertrain_config>.yml
    sort_component: true

A description of the powertrain customization is available here. It includes a description of powertrain configuation
file, lists of the components available, their constraints and simple powertrain templates.
