Life Cycle Cost model assumptions
=================================

The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC).

* Each powertrain component’s production cost is defined as its purchase cost.
* The costs of the DC bus and DC splitter are neglected due to their close association with the DC cable.
* Engines and propellers operational costs are the overhaul cost divided over Time Between Overhauls (TBO).
* Electric sources and electronics operational costs are their replacement cost divided over their lifespan.
* The purchase cost of the electronics are estimated based on the amount of electric loads.
* Storage tanks and transmission mechanisms maintenance costs are included in the aircraft’s annual maintenance.
* In the DC cable model, the shield and core unit costs are set equal, as are the insulation and sheath costs.
