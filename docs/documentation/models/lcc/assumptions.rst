=================================

The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC).

* The operation cost of the engines and propeller are the annual split of their overhaul cost.
* The operation cost of the electric source and loads are the annual split of their replacement cost.
* The purchase cost of the electronics are estimated based on the amount of electric loads.
* The storage tank maintenance costs are combined in the aircraft annual maintenance cost.
* The operation cost of the storage tank is the estimated annual fuel cost.
* The electricity cost is included in the battery operation cost.
* The transmission maintenance costs are combined in the aircraft annual maintenance cost.
* The loan financing in :ref:`options-lca` is ``True`` as default for most financing cases.
