Life Cycle Cost model assumptions
=================================

The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the Life Cycle Cost (LCC).

* Engines and propellers operational costs are the overhaul cost divided over Time Between Overhauls (TBO).
* Electric sources and electronics operational costs are their replacement cost divided over their lifespan.
* The purchase cost of the electronics are estimated based on the amount of electric loads.
* The storage tank and transmission maintenance costs are included in the aircraft annual maintenance cost.
