=========================================
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell option
=========================================

*************************
Fuel cell position option
*************************
The PEMFC model has four possible installation position shown as:

| "wing_pod" : Tank installed under the wing with user specified position.
| "underbelly" : Tank installed under and outside the fuselage.
| "in_the_front" : Tank installed at the front section inside the fuselage.
| "in_the_back" : Tank installed at the rear section inside the fuselage.

******************************
Model fidelity option
******************************
This option offers flexibility in setting between the two polarization models of PEMFC, empirical model and analytical
model. :ref:`The empirical model <models-pemfc-empirical>` is based on the empirical data of Aerostak 200W from
:cite:`hoogendoorn:2018`. :ref:`The analytical model <models-pemfc-analytical>` is derived from standard fuel cell
polarization curve calculation from :cite:`juschus:2021`.
