The gaseous hydrogen tank is a storage option in FAST-OAD-CS23-HE, designed to store hydrogen in its gas-phase.
This component can be activated through the powertrain configuration file (PT file) and
customized by editing in the source code.

A brief description of the gaseous hydrogen tank component is shown below.
Including the component computation logic, options for customization, and model assumptions.
