Gaseous Hydrogen Tank assumptions
=================================

The followings are the assumptions that applied in the gaseous hydrogen tank computation.

* The hydrogen gas in the tank is considered ideal gas.
* The hydrogen properties remain static during the whole mission.
* The tank body maintains a uniform wall thickness.
* The hydrogen tank capacity while applying enforce constraint is the sum of the design mission consumption and the
  unused hydrogen in the tank. The trapped (unused) hydrogen is estimated as 3% of the design mission consumption
  based on :cite:`ahluwalia:2010`.
* The number of tank per stack remains as single tank for components installed outside the fuselage.
