==============================================
Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell assumptions
==============================================
The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of PEMFC.

* The hydrogen and oxygen (or air) in PEMFC are consider as ideal gas.
* The operating temperature of PEMFC remains equivalent to the ambient temperature.
* The hydrogen operating pressure remains constant as the user defined in source file.
* The oxygen partial pressure is set to 21% of the operating pressure.
* The operating pressure is equivalent to ambient pressure if no compressor is connected.
* The pressure of both electrodes in simple polarization model are assumed the same.
