Proton-exchange membrane fuel cell assumptions
==============================================

The followings are the assumptions that applied in the Proton-Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) computation.

* The operating temperature of PEMFC remains equivalent to the ambient temperature.
* The hydrogen operating pressure for the analytical model remains constant as the user defined in source file.
* The oxygen partial pressure of the analytical model is set to 21% of the overall operating pressure.
* The operating pressure remains equivalent to the ambient pressure if no compressor is connected.
