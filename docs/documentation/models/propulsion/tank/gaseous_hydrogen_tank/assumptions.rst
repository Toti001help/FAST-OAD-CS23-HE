Gaseous hydrogen tank assumptions
=================================

The following assumptions have been made in the calculation of the gaseous hydrogen tank.

* The hydrogen in the tank is assumed to be an ideal gas.
* The hydrogen properties remain static throughout the mission.
* The tank body has a uniform wall thickness.
* The hydrogen tank capacity is the sum of the design mission consumption and the unused hydrogen in the tank. The captured (unused) hydrogen is estimated to be 3% of the design mission consumption  based on :cite:`ahluwalia:2010`.
* The number of tanks per stack remains as a single tank for components installed outside the fuselage.
