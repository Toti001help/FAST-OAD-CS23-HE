Gaseous Hydrogen Tank assumptions
=================================

The followings are the assumptions that applied in the gaseous hydrogen tank computation.

* The hydrogen gas in the tank are considered ideal gas.
* The hydrogen properties remain the same during the whole mission.
* The tank has uniform thickness thoughout the whole tank body.
* The hydrogen tank capacity while applying enforece constraint is the sum of the design mission consumption and the
  unused hydrogen in the tank. The trapped (unused) hydrogen is estimated as 3% of the design mission consumption
  based on :cite:`ahluwalia:2010`.
* The number of tank per stack remains as 1.0 for components installed outside the fuselage.
