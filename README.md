FAST-OAD-CS23-HE: FAST-OAD-CS23 Extension for the sizing of hybrid electric aircraft
======================================================================================

FAST-OAD-CS23-HE is derived from FAST-OAD framework performing rapid Overall Aircraft Design and 
will contain models and methods for the sizing of a hybrid electric aircraft. 

This repository was created to contain the files created for the thesis *Optimization of an 
aircraft design problem for hybrid-electric configurations
under manufacturing and certification constraints* and *Intégration de la discipline de gestion 
thermique dans la conception conceptuelle et préliminaire de nouvelles configurations d'avions*
